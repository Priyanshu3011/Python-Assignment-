    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class defines a set of properties and methods that describe the behavior and characteristics of objects that belong to that class.\n",
    "The properties represent the data associated with the object, while the methods represent the operations or behaviors that the object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a specific instance of a class, with its own set of values for the properties defined by the class. \n",
    "You can create multiple objects of the same class, each with its own unique set of values for the properties.\n",

    "Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class that is being inherited from is called the parent class, while the class that is inheriting is called the child class or derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a child class inherits from a parent class, it automatically gets all the properties and methods of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The child class can also add its own unique properties and methods, or override the ones that it inherits from the parent class.\n",

    "1.Single Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a child class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
