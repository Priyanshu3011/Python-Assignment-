    "1. Definition: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to a particular context while hiding the unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Purpose: Abstraction aims to manage complexity and make a system more understandable. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Consider a car. In an abstract sense, we are interested in the fact that a car can move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right. We don't need to know the intricate details of how the car's engine, transmission, and brakes work internally to achieve these actions. This abstraction allows us to work with cars without needing to understand all the inner workings.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, providing control over the interactions with the object's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose**: Encapsulation aims to protect an object's internal state from unauthorized access and modification. It helps ensure data integrity and enables controlled access through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example**: Let's take a simple example of a Python class representing a bank account:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Using double underscores to indicate a private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `BankAccount` is a class that encapsulates the account's attributes (`account_number` and `__balance`) and methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance`). The `__balance` attribute is marked as private by using double underscores, which means it cannot be directly accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: The abstraction here is that a bank account can be used to deposit and withdraw money, and you can check its balance. Users of this class don't need to know how the balance is stored or manipulated internally; they only interact with the provided methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is evident in how the data (balance) is encapsulated within the class, and access to it is controlled through methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance`. This protects the balance from being modified directly without going through these methods, ensuring that the account's state remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction simplifies the view of an object, focusing on what it does, while encapsulation bundles data and methods together and controls access to them to ensure data integrity and security."

    "Ans:- The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module in the Python Standard Library that provides mechanisms for defining abstract base classes in Python and enforcing the implementation of specific methods by subclasses. Abstract base classes are a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes without necessarily providing a complete implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the `abc` module is used and its main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Abstract Base Classes**: The `abc` module allows you to define abstract base classes using the `ABC` class as a base. Abstract base classes are classes that are not meant to be instantiated directly but serve as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforcing Method Implementation**: Abstract base classes can define abstract methods, which are methods that do not have a concrete implementation in the base class. Subclasses derived from these abstract base classes are required to implement these abstract methods. This ensures that specific methods are present in subclasses, providing a form of contract or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Checking and Duck Typing**: Abstract base classes can be used to perform type checking and ensure that objects conform to a specific interface. This helps in writing more robust code and making sure that objects have the expected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Abstract base classes can serve as a form of documentation, making it clear what methods and properties are expected to be implemented by subclasses.\n",

    "Ans:-Data abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, particularly in object-oriented programming. It involves simplifying complex data structures by exposing only the necessary features and hiding the implementation details. Data abstraction allows you to work with data at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on what data represents and how it can be manipulated rather than how it's stored or implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can achieve data abstraction using the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**:\n",
    "   - Define classes that represent the abstract data types you want to work with.\n",
    "   - Encapsulate data within these classes using attributes (instance variables).\n",
    "   - Provide methods (functions) to interact with and manipulate the data.\n",
    "   - Use access modifiers like public, private, and protected (e.g., `_variable` or `__variable`) to control access to data members.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class BankAccount:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "           self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "           self.__balance = balance  # Encapsulation, private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "       def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "           if amount > 0:\n",
    "               self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "       def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "           if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "               self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "       def get_balance(self):\n",
    "           return self.__balance\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**:\n",
    "   - Use the `abc` module to define abstract base classes with abstract methods.\n",
    "   - Subclasses must implement these abstract methods, enforcing a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def perimeter(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interfaces**:\n",
    "   - In Python, interfaces are often represented using abstract base classes with only abstract methods.\n",
    "   - Subclasses implement these methods to provide the required functionality.\n",
    "   - While Python does not have a dedicated `interface` keyword, this pattern is commonly used for achieving data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Printable(ABC):\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def print(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Document(Printable):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, content):\n",
    "           self.content = content\n",
    "\n",
    "       def print(self):\n",
    "           print(self.content)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Module-Level Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Use functions and classes in modules to provide high-level, abstracted access to data and operations.\n",
    "   - Module-level abstraction allows you to group related functionality and hide internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Module-level abstraction\n",
    "   def calculate_area(shape):\n",
    "       return shape.area()\n",
    "\n",
    "   def calculate_perimeter(shape):\n",
    "       return shape.perimeter()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these techniques, you can achieve data abstraction in Python. The goal is to create well-defined interfaces (either through classes or module-level functions) that allow you to work with data in a simplified and meaningful way, hiding the complexity of data structures and implementation details."

    "Ans:-No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python.

    "Attempting to create an instance of an abstract class would be ambiguous because there are methods within the abstract class that have no implementation, and it would not make sense to invoke those methods on an instance.
